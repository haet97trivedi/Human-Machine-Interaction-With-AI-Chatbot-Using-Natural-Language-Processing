## Introduction

The current college website, while containing substantial content, suffers from a lack of user-friendly design, especially on mobile devices. The project aims to create a responsive and interactive web interface with a chatbot that can engage with users and answer their queries. In addition, the website will be enhanced with details of various committees and events.

## Aim and Objective

The project aims to improve the existing website's shortcomings, making it responsive and easy for users. The objective is to enable users to access information comfortably, without requiring physical visits to the college. The virtual tour of the college is also a feature aimed at increasing the ease for prospective students.

## Scope

The improved college website aims to serve various user classes, including existing students, recruiters, and prospective students. It will provide easy access to important information like notices, syllabi, previous placement records, upcoming events, admission cut-offs, faculty details, and committee information.

## Existing Problems

The current website lacks responsiveness and navigation ease, especially on smaller screens. The design looks cluttered and certain images are cut off due to irregular layout.

## Hardware and Software Requirements

Hardware: 4GB RAM, 1TB HDD, Intel Core Processor, Graphic Card, NIC Card, Windows 10 Operating System.

Software: Visual Studio Code, GitHub, HTML, BootStrap, Javascript, Google Dialog Flow.

## Requirement Analysis

This section includes the functional and non-functional requirements of the chatbot and the website.

## Proposed System

The proposed system integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the chatbot to accept unstructured output and produce structured representation of the text. The chatbot follows a Retrieval based architectural model, which allows it to understand the context of the conversation and deliver appropriate responses.

## Design

The design of the system considers responsiveness, screen resolution, maintainability, and precision. The website's structure includes a Use Case Diagram, Data Flow Diagrams, and a Sequence Diagram.

## Implementation Methodology

The implementation involved requirement gathering, layout designing, HTML and CSS coding for the layout, JavaScript coding for functional events, and Google Dialog Flow for training the chatbot.

## Conclusion

The improved website and the chatbot are more responsive, user-friendly, and interactive than the existing system. The chatbot is capable of responding to legitimate user questions and updating notices via voice chat, making the website more efficient and effective for users.
